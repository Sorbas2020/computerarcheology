Fixed the data representation at the bottom of the save-game viewer. I pointed the main text to the save-game
viewer for the map.

Move my walkthrough to a separate page. That way it can be open next to the emulator.

I wired the 6809 emulator to the page. You can now play the game
right here. It outputs a text-virtual-tape for save/load.

I added a save-game-viewer to show the details of the text-virtual-tape.

TODO:
  * write up about the save-game-viewer
  * Ability to load files through the URL
  * Add my conversion beside the CAS files
  * Link to the the CAS/VT tool
