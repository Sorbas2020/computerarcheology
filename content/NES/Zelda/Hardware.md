# Mapper 1: MMC1

| | | |

| 8000:9FFFw | MMC1_0 | |
| A000:BFFFw | MMC1_1 | |
| C000:EFFFw | MMC1_2 | |
| E000:FFFFw | MMC1_3 | |

 The Legend of Zelda uses the MMC1 chip to map the RAM/ROM banks for the CPU and PPU.
 MMC1 is controlled by writing to 8000-FFFF (assumes that this area is ROM where
 writes have no effect). There are 4 5-bit registers in the MMC1. Writing to 8000-9FFF
 sends data to register 0. A000-BFFF writes to register 1, C000-DFFF to register 2, and 
 E000-FFFF to register 3.

 The MMC1 register data is shifted in with 5 consecutive writes. Bit 0 of the written value
 goes to bit-0 on the first write then bit-1 on the second. After 5 the bit-pointer goes
 back to bit-0. If bit 7 of the written value is 1 then the 5-bit register is cleared and
 the pointer goes back to bit-0 for the NEXT write.
