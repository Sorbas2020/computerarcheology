# Pictures and Comments from Peter

A few years ago, I worked on a C16 and a C64 port of the classic arcade game.
At this point in time the game was not available on the website `computerarcheology.com`.
I had to manually copy all graphics from the screen.

On the right side of the picture below, you can see the relativ coordinates data needed for a real particle explosion.
Animation frames are from letter A to N. Sidenote: the arcade version is not doing a 'real' one, because it simlpy deletes the background and does not restore it.

On the left side you see the possible 'sub sequences' for the horizontal movements of the big birds. This is very important for a smooth animation.
I still need to find that data in the code of the arcade version....

On the left below you can see an 'improved' version of the player shields.
I added more tiles and animation frames to make it beautiful for my commodore port.
On the right you can see the result of a conversion from 32x26 screen size to 40x25. (..and sorry the same paper was used a second time for a movement track)

The 10 animation frames of the 'bonus explosion' shown below.

Below is some 'offline' work of the current investigations.
Finding out the meaning of suspect numbers and putting them in a grid.
It is important to assign a name or number to each alien.
Because there will be fixed trigger points used later when the movement starts.
